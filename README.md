# Automating Deployment of AWS Amplify Apps with Terraform ðŸŽ‰

This workshop is a guided example of how you can leverage Terraform and the **[AWS Amplify Libraries for JavaScript](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/q/platform/js/)** to build fullstack AWS Amplify Apps. With this process, you can have full control over your backend resources, while gaining the benefits of what Amplify can help automate for you.


For getting started quickly, check out **[code examples](https://github.com/novekm/amplify-with-terraform/tree/main/terraform-deployment/examples)**.
